# dashi-histogram

This project provides a multi-dimensional histogram in C++11 with behavior and HDF5 storage analogous to [dashi](https://github.com/IceCube-SPNO/dashi).

A demo is provided in `histogram_demo.cpp` that can be built with `make`, assuming that `libhdf5` is in your linker path and that your compiler supports C++11.
